        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of each version of your project.</li>
          <li>GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that allows us to keep track of our projects inside repositories that are stored remotely.</li>
          <li>A branch is a copy or version of the code that can be worked on independently in isolation so development changes do not disrupt other team members who are also working on the code and testing their solutions. When we are typically working on code, it is in an unstable state since we are actively developing the code.</li>
          <li>MVP stands for minimum viable product. This is usually the first iteration of a product without extra features. After completing an MVP, development may move on to a different, more robust version and the addition of extra features to make the app more user-friendly or more functional. However, the MVP is an important milestone in the development process because it is the first version that fulfills the requirements and proves that the solution to the program works.</li>
          <li>Git commands</li>
          <ul>
            <li>git status:.............. Checks what branch we are currently on</li>
            <li>git checkout -b branch-name:.............. creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
            <li>git add -A:...........  Adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area. The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes.</li>
            <li>git commit -m "commit message":.................. A commit will be created that captures a snapshot of the currently staged changes.  [According to Git, the key to writing effective commit messages is to write them as imperative commands in the present tense.]</li>
            <li>git pull origin main:............... To pull down any changes from the base branch (to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment). [Before we push this up to our repo, we should double-check if our local branch is in sync with the base branch in GitHub.]. The "origin" keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The "main" keyword indicates the branch.</li>
            <li>git push origin branch-name:............... To push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch.</li>
          </ul>
